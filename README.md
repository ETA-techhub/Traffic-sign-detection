# Traffic-sign-detection 🚦🛑

This repository contains a deep learning-based solution for **traffic sign detection and classification**. The project aims to accurately identify traffic signs from images or real-time video feed, supporting the development of autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).

## 📁 Project Structure

- `traffic_sign_detection.py`:  
  Core script for detecting and classifying traffic signs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning:** CNN, GAN  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow / PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Tasks:** Image Classification, Object Detection, Data Augmentation

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** or similar datasets containing labeled images of various traffic signs, such as:

- Speed limit signs  
- Stop signs  
- Yield signs  
- No entry, pedestrian crossings, etc.

## 🏁 Key Features

- Real-time detection with webcam or video input  
- GAN-based data augmentation for improved generalization  
- Multi-class classification with high accuracy  
- Support for dataset expansion and model tuning

## 🚀 Future Work

- Deploy model on edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano)  
- Integrate with real-time navigation systems  
- Add support for object tracking and motion prediction
